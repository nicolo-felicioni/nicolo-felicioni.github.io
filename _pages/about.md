Since November 2021, I am a Ph.D. student at the Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria 
([DEIB](https://www.deib.polimi.it/)), in the [RecSys lab](https://recsys.deib.polimi.it/)
of [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/).


Research Interests
---
My main research interest is in Machine Learning. In particular, I am focusing on Off-Policy Evaluation and Learning from Contextual Bandit feedback.
This research topic finds applications in many fields such as recommendation systems, treatment effect evaluation, information retrieval. 
I am also interested in Reinforcement Learning, Causal Inference, Statistics, and Deep Learning.
