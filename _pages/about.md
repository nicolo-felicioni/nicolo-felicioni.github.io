I am a final-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/), where I work in the [RecSys Lab](https://recsys.deib.polimi.it/) under the supervision of Prof. Paolo Cremonesi. My research focuses on developing and evaluating AI agents that can safely and effectively interact with the real world.

Research Interests
---
My research lies at the intersection of AI Agents, Multi-Armed Bandits, and Large Language Models. I am particularly interested in:
- Off-Policy Evaluation and Learning for AI agents
- Decision-making with Large Language Models
- Uncertainty estimation in machine Large Models
- Applications to recommendation systems and human-AI interaction
